# Delivery Weekly Report Template

A one page weekly report format to keep outsourced delivery explainable to stakeholders.

## Sections
1. Outcomes shipped this week  
2. Scope status, what changed, what did not  
3. Quality status, tests executed, defects, escaped defect risk  
4. Risks and mitigations  
5. Decisions needed, owner, due date  
6. Next week plan, deliverables and acceptance gates  

## Operating rule
Keep it to one page. Send on the same day each week. If there is no change, say so.
